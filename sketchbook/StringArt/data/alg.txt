circular white canvas of radius r
n nails around the edge

input image pixels
convert to grayscale
map values 0 (black) to 1 (white)

two points (nails) determine a line
angle 1 and angle 2 (r never changes)

finitely many possible strings
n choose 2

string0 * 0 + string1 * 1 + string2 * 1 + ... + stringN * 0 = image
coeficients 0 and 1

linear combination of strings = target image

store each 2D string image as a 1D vector, ai (a0 - an)
store 2D target image as 1D vector b

put all of the vectors a as rows in a matrix A

The coeficents X will be the solution of Ax = b

x = pseudoinverse(A) * b <- easy to calculate with computer
